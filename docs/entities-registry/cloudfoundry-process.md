| Attribute  | Type | Description  | Examples  | [Requirement Level](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/general/attribute-requirement-level/) | Stability |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [`cloudfoundry.process.id`](../attributes-registry/cloudfoundry.md) | string | The UID identifying the process. [1] | `218fc5a9-a5f1-4b54-aa05-46717d0ab26d` | `Recommended` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |
| [`cloudfoundry.process.type`](../attributes-registry/cloudfoundry.md) | string | The type of process. [2] | `web` | `Recommended` | ![Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/-development-blue) |

**[1] `cloudfoundry.process.id`:** Application instrumentation should use the value from environment
variable `VCAP_APPLICATION.process_id`. It is supposed to be equal to
`VCAP_APPLICATION.app_id` for applications deployed to the runtime.
For system components, this could be the actual PID.

**[2] `cloudfoundry.process.type`:** CloudFoundry applications can consist of multiple jobs. Usually the
main process will be of type `web`. There can be additional background
tasks or side-cars with different process types.
